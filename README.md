## Motivation?

Why not `lodash/fp` you might ask?

I learn fp from book 'HTDP', with programing language Scheme & Dr.Racket. I
practically could use `lodash/fp` but I don't want to. Making those little
functions here makes me happy. In the serious project I would most certainly
use `lodash/fp`.

- `explode`
- `implode`
- `first`
- `rest`
- `take`
- `drop`
- `is.zero`
- `is.int`
- `is.float`
- `is.odd`
- `is.even`
- `is.empty`
- `add1`
- `fill`
